# Project status and handoff

Snapshot for the next contributor (human or coding agent) of **The Ultimate
Football Reference**. It says what is built, what was decided, and what is left.

- **Repo:** <https://github.com/slavisah/football-reference> (public)
- **Live site:** <https://slavisah.github.io/football-reference/>
- **Stack:** Astro + TypeScript + pnpm, static output, Markdown as source of
  truth. Vitest (unit) + Playwright (mobile smoke). Deploys via GitHub Actions
  to GitHub Pages.

## How to run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev                       # local preview
pnpm lint                      # astro check (types)
pnpm test                      # 19 Vitest unit tests
pnpm build                     # static build + all content validation
PW_CHROME_CHANNEL=chrome pnpm test:e2e   # 5 Playwright tests at 360px
```

Publishing: push to `main`; the Pages workflow builds and deploys.

## Done - Milestone 1 (complete and verified)

All Milestone 1 items from `prompts/INITIAL_CODING_AGENT_PROMPT.md` are
implemented, and every acceptance scenario passes.

- [x] Shared page shell, navigation, footer
- [x] Home page (with live champion counts read from the tables)
- [x] FIFA World Cup page
- [x] UEFA EURO page
- [x] Reusable responsive tournament table (stacks into cards on mobile)
- [x] Filter by **winner** and **year**, shareable via URL query params
- [x] **Generated** champions summary (from the table, not hand-maintained)
- [x] References section with source links (from `docs/SOURCES.md`)
- [x] Visible `lastReviewed` date per page
- [x] Accessible print styles (A4 landscape; hidden rows still print)
- [x] Mobile layout at 360px with no horizontal overflow
- [x] Light and dark themes (OS default + persisted toggle, no flash)
- [x] Build-time validation of front matter and tables
- [x] Vitest unit tests (19) and Playwright mobile smoke test (5)
- [x] GitHub Pages deploy workflow (live and green)

### Acceptance scenarios -> status

1. Child finds the 2018 World Cup champion on a phone, no overflow - **pass**
2. Selecting Spain shows Spain's title years - **pass**
3. Print the World Cup table on A4 landscape - **pass** (print stylesheet)
4. Every competition page shows `lastReviewed` and source links - **pass**
5. Keyboard users can operate filters - **pass**
6. `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, mobile Playwright test pass - **pass**
7. Deploys to GitHub Pages via Actions - **pass**

### Where the important code is

- `src/lib/markdownTable.ts` - GFM table parser
- `src/lib/editions.ts` - normalizes rows, builds champions summary + winner list
- `src/lib/validate.ts` - build-time validation rules
- `src/lib/countries.ts` - the West Germany/Germany grouping
- `src/lib/competition.ts` - loads a competition (editions + summary + sources)
- `src/components/TournamentTable.astro` - table + filters (client script)
- `src/components/ChampionsSummary.astro`, `References.astro`, `CompetitionView.astro`
- `src/content.config.ts` - front-matter schema (zod)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI build + Pages deploy

## Decisions on record

- **West Germany is counted as Germany** in the generated title totals only,
  displayed as "Germany (incl. West Germany)". This is the single sporting-
  successor grouping applied, because it is the only one the source content
  itself makes. The **edition tables always keep the historical name**, and the
  winner filter lists "West Germany" and "Germany" separately on purpose.
  Implemented in `src/lib/countries.ts`; explained on-page under the summary.
- **Emoji policy = allowed in UI accents and in Markdown content ("Both").**
  Decided, but **not yet implemented** (see "Left to do"). Conventions are
  written in `docs/ADDING_CONTENT.md` section 6: family-friendly and sparing,
  never inside data-table cells, and **no flag emojis for defunct nations**
  (West Germany, Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia).
- **Markdown stays the source of truth**; tables are parsed at build time. No
  `generated/` JSON was needed yet.
- **Champions summary is generated**, so any hand-written totals table in a
  content file is intentionally not rendered.
- **Base path is repository-agnostic**: `astro.config.mjs` reads `SITE_URL` and
  `BASE_PATH` from env, which the deploy workflow fills from
  `actions/configure-pages`.

## Left to do

### Next up: implement the emoji decision ("Both")

Decision is made; implementation is pending. Concretely:

- **UI accents** (decorative, `aria-hidden="true"`): e.g. 🏆 on the
  "Champions by titles" heading in `ChampionsSummary.astro`; 📚 on the
  References heading in `References.astro`; small icons on the home feature list
  / competition cards in `src/pages/index.astro`. Keep it subtle.
- **Content emojis**: add a light touch to the "Memorable moments" sections in
  `content/fifa-world-cup.md` and `content/uefa-euro.md`, following the
  conventions above (no flags for historical nations; none in the Editions
  table).
- Re-run `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build` and the Playwright smoke test;
  confirm no horizontal overflow at 360px still holds.

### Milestone 2: remaining pages (content already exists in `content/`)

Reuse the same `loadCompetition` + `CompetitionView` pattern (see
`docs/ADDING_CONTENT.md` section 7). Note the table headings in these files may
differ from `## Editions` and will need the matching `editionsHeading`:

- [x] Copa América (`content/copa-america.md`) - used `editionsHeading:
      'Champions timeline'` and `allowDuplicateYears: ['1959']` for the two 1959
      editions. Page at `src/pages/competitions/copa-america.astro`.
- [x] UEFA Nations League (`content/uefa-nations-league.md`) - uses seasons
      like `2018-19`; the parser already handles season labels. Page at
      `src/pages/competitions/nations-league.astro`.
- [x] Men's Ballon d'Or (`content/ballon-dor.md`) - reused the existing
      `loadCompetition`/`CompetitionView` pattern as-is (`editionsHeading:
      'Winners'`); the generic table already handles "winner + national team,
      no host/teams" since it only renders columns that are present. Page at
      `src/pages/competitions/ballon-dor.astro`. The 2020 "Not awarded" row is
      preserved verbatim and passes validation (non-empty winner), though it
      does appear as its own one-off entry in the generated champions summary
      and winner filter - a known minor rough edge, not fixed here.
- [x] Golden Boot / top scorers (`content/golden-boot.md`) - two tables (World
      Cup and EURO top scorers) in one file. Page at
      `src/pages/competitions/golden-boot.astro`. Since one content file holds
      two tables, `loadCompetition('golden-boot', ...)` is called twice with a
      different `editionsHeading` per table ("FIFA World Cup top scorers" /
      "UEFA EURO top scorers"), and the page composes two
      `TournamentTable` + `ChampionsSummary` blocks under one shared header and
      a single, merged `References` section. The "Player(s)" column is now
      recognized as the winner/champion column (`/player/` added to the
      matcher in `src/lib/editions.ts` and the highlight regex in
      `TournamentTable.astro`), and both `TournamentTable` (`winnerLabel` prop)
      and `ChampionsSummary` (`heading`/`description`/`unit` props) gained
      small optional overrides so the copy reads correctly for a top-scorer
      award instead of a "champion" competition - existing pages are
      unaffected since every new prop defaults to the old text. Added a
      Playwright block covering the two-table layout at 360px and independent
      per-table filtering.
- [ ] Records and timelines (`content/records-and-timelines.md`) -> `/records`,
      composing generated timelines from the competition tables.

### From `docs/WEBSITE_REQUIREMENTS.md`, still missing

- [ ] `/quiz` - family quiz generated from the structured editions
- [ ] `/about/sources` - a sources index page (data already in `docs/SOURCES.md`)
- [ ] Additional filters mentioned in `AGENTS.md` (by host, by team)
- [ ] Sort controls that preserve historical notes

### Nice-to-have / later

- [ ] Add the Playwright smoke test as a CI job (needs
      `pnpm test:e2e:install`); currently run locally to keep deploys fast.
- [ ] Compare two national teams; "on this day" cards
- [ ] Installable PWA / offline reading; per-competition print sheet download
- [ ] Optional Croatian/English localization

## Known caveats

- World Cup, EURO, Nations League, Copa América, Ballon d'Or, and Golden Boot
  have pages so far; Records and timelines is still validated as front matter
  only, not yet rendered.
- Historical names appear as distinct winner-filter entries by design.
- First-ever Pages deploy can hang in GitHub's `updating_pages` provisioning and
  time out; re-running the deploy clears it (it did here).
